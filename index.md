# What is Git and why do you want it?

Git is a _revision control management system_[^git][^gitbook]. It helps you
keep track of changes to your files. You've probably had the following thing
happen to you before:

I certainly have:

Notice:

- Different versions of the same document have different filenames.
- The date and author of a change are encoded haphazardly in the filename.
- Serial edits by different authors are concatenated in the filename, with no
  indication as to whose edit came first.
- These are just five files in one directory; other revisions are probably
  scattered around my various hard drives and as email attachments.

This is known as _revision hell_, and it happens when you don't use revision
control, even if you are working alone. Systems such as git save you from this.

There are (at least) three stages of git enlightenment:

1. Maintain a linear history for a file or group of files.
2. Use branches effectively to group related changes together, as well as
   maintain parallel versions.
3. Use branches and pull-requests to collaborate effectively.

It took me a long time to pass all three, and I hope this tutorial will help
someone get there faster.

A final thing to keep in mind while you're learning: git is *hard*.
It's difficult enough to keep all the branching histories straight, but
worse, its user interface is notoriously inscrutable and seemingly random.
I consider myself a git "power user", and I still often Google commands for
it.
I privately maintain a list of "git WTFs", commands that make no sense at all.
I hope to one day turn these into a book.

Now, after reading that, you might wonder, "why would anyone want to learn
this?"
The answer is that the *backbone* of git, how it maintains your data and
communicates between different copies of your data, is extremely solid and
well-thought-out.
The UI needs work, yes, but that can always be improved.
There are, in fact, many reasonable git "clients", which make the day-to-day of
git nicer.
This tutorial, however, is about the hard basics.
Understand those, and all other clients will feel deliciously simple.
